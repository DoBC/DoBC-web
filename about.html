            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>This website was created by three students at OsloMet University. It’s a result of a semester project in the subject “Practical IT project”. 
               Our task was to make a digitalized version of Johannes Daae’s tool “Dimensions of behavior change” which until now only was available in the 
               form of a physical card deck, presenting nine dimensions that behavior changing strategies may be adjusted along to be optimized for the specific purpose at hand. 
            </p>
            <p>      
               “Dimensions of Behaviour Change” is a tool developed to help behavior designers make more informed decisions about which behavior changing strategies they choose, 
               and how these are applied in the design. The purpose is to optimize the likelihood of the target group accepting the design and their behavior being changed.  
            </p>  
            <p>    
               Our goal has been to make the tool accessible and available to a much larger audience. The tool is now reachable on every platform both mobile and web browser and is 
               free to use for everybody.
