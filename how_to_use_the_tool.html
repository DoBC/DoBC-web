            <h2>How to use the tool</h2>
            <p>Dimensions of Behavior Change is a tool that will help designers make more informed decisions when choosing strategies 
                on how to solve a behavior problem using design changes.  
            </p>
            <p>The tool will be able to give concrete examples with examples on how to persuade people to make changes. By using the 
               tools interface and using the scaling of dimensions functionality in the application users can define how they want the 
               problem to be solved based on their pursued goal and wishes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The tool consists of nine dimension categories:
            </p>
            <p><b>Control</b></p>
            <p> 
                 The control dimension category consists of two extremes. On one side is “user in control” and on the opposite side is “product in control”. 
                This dimension can for example help the designer determine whether the user or the product is in control.
            </p>
            <p><b>Obtrusiveness</b></p>
            <p> 
                The dimension obtrusiveness consists of the two extremes “obtrusive” and “unobtrusive”. This dimension is meant to decide how much attention 
                the product demands from the user
            </p>
            <p><b>Meaning</b></p>
            <p>
                Meaning is a dimension that is used to consider if the user has a wish for certain behaviors. Sometimes user's behavior is based on an emotional 
                or reasoning thought. By making something fun users might change behavior while making some meaningful and reasonable it can impact a user's behavior.  
            </p>
            <p><b>Exposure</b></p>
            <p>
                A question the designer could face is how often the user will be exposed to the product. The two extremes are “rarely” and “frequently” and are 
                variables that could be considered when designing a product.  
            </p>
            <p><b>Encouragement</b></p>
            <p>
                Encouragement have three points on the scale promote, neutral and discourage. Promoting is about using a positive approach to motivate behavior 
                change while discourage is about informing the user of negative consequences of the behavior but not force a change in the behavior. Neutral is 
                about giving information to the user without informing of either negative or positive consequence of the behavior like for example how much water 
                used, but not if that usage was positive or negative
            </p>
            <p><b>Timing</b></p>
            <p>
                The dimensions timing is about trying to affect the user's behavior at a certain stage in the user phase. Either before use, during interaction or 
                after use can be phases where you want to inform the user to make them change behavior.  
            </p>
            <p><b>Empathy</b></p>
            <p>
                Empathy is a dimension known from literature and is meant to encourage change in users behaviour by considering collective concerns on side and 
                individual concerns on the other side. The two extremes in the dimension empathy is “me” and “others”. The designer can use this dimension by 
                playing on users concern about themselves versus the concern about others 
            </p>
            <p><b>Importance</b></p>
            <p>
                Importance is a dimension based on the user's opinion on the importance of their behavior. For example, might a lot of drivers find usage of seatbelt 
                important and want that behavior, but forgets to check passengers. Having sensors reminding them of using seatbelts might make them aware, change behavior 
                and use the seatbelts which they originally thought is important but had forgotten. Unimportant for a user might be saving energy while traveling since 
                it’s for a short period and they might need to be forced to change their behavior. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Direction</b></p>
            <p>
                The direction dimension is used in literature as a description of change of behavior is in line with what the users originally believed and valued. 
                The scale used for the dimension direction is In line and opposing. In line might be affecting behavior the users are already doing and want to do but 
                need guidance to do it optimally. Opposing means making the user do something they originally didn’t want to do like taking the bike instead of driving.
